# Weather App Practice Project

## Overview
This app was created as a practice project for *fetch API* and calling two APIs as well (*openweather API* and *ipinfo.io API.*)

## Features
- The website will get at least the country and a close city for where the client request is coming from by using ipinfo.io API (if the limit of calls had been made, there will be a default city for the app)
- You'll be able to get current weather information for any city as well as a 5-day forecast for that city by using the openWeather API

## Running the project
- If you try my github page for this project you'll need to have a openWeather API key and a ipinfo.io API key; for more info...
---* [Open Weather Website](https://openweathermap.org/api)
---* [Ipinfo Website](https://ipinfo.io/)
---* Once you click on my github page you'll be able to enter both keys on a context window
- If you plan to run the project locally, set up your keys on the properties located in config.js
